# Introduction

[Leyden][leyden-repo] is a data table framework powered by [Slate][slate].

Leyden lets you build complex tables for viewing and editing your data, your way. It's just a thin, table-shaped wrapper on top of Slate. Leyden doesn't abstract Slate away from you; its power and flexibility of Slate are always in reach. It's possible (and highly recommended) to use Slate directly within Leyden tables.

Slate inspired almost every aspect Leyden, including its API, package structure, and type system. If you have a question that isn't answered by these docs, there's a good chance you can find an answer in [Slate's documentation][slate-docs]. They're an excellent resource to keep on hand while working with Leyden.
