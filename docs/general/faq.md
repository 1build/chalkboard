## What does "Leyden" mean?

Leyden's name is a reference to the [Leyden jar][leyden-jar]. Invented in the mid-1740's, it is the original form of the [capacitor][capacitor]. Benjamin Franklin [coined the term "battery"][franklin-battery] in reference to several connected Leyden jars, bringing the name full-circle: Leyden → Leyden jar → battery → cells → data tables. This connection is a bit tenuous; to be frank, the primary naming consideration was [npm availability][npm-leyden].
